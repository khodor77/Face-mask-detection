# Model-Training

<#> Real time face mask detection using CNN

<#> Model is trained on google colab , the dataset collected from kaggle you can find it here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset

<#> 3 convolutional layers are used followed by maxpooling , flattening and dense layers.

<#> Trained for 15 epochs and a batch size of 32.

<#> Results can be viewed on plottings with the help of Matplotlib library.

# Face-and-mask-detection

<#> Loaded face detection model from OpenCv and our trained model for mask detection

<#> Preprocessed the frames detected from live webcam

<#> Green box is displayed if mask in on and red box otherwise.
